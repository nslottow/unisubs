Optional Apps
=============
Amara.org uses several apps/packages that are stored in private github
repositories that add extra functionality for paid partnerships.  These apps
are optional -- the amara codebase runs fine without them.

The coding issue is how to make amara work without these repositories, but
automatically pull them in if they are present.  Here's how we do it:

* For each repository we create a file inside the optional/ directory:

  * The filename is the name of the repository
  * The contents are the git commit ID that we want to use

* To enable a repository, it must be checked out in the amara root directory,
  using the same name as the git repository.

* The optionalapps module handles figuring out which repositories are present
  and how we should modify things at runtime
